# sksp2024-react-native-app

Simple react native app for my workshop.

## Steps

1. Go to [react native documentation](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup) and follow installation instructions with expo
   - Run `npx create-expo-app@latest`
2. Install dependencies for our new `npm` project
   - `npm install`
3. Start our freshly bootstrapped app
   - `npm run start`
4. Play around with the app on phone and on web
5. Delete contents of `index.tsx` and replace it with simple counter
